- general screens: add checkbox for 'show all containers/images' (-a option)

- the way that i force ratchet to flush the write stream sucks. (but i don't know better).

- must have some form of SSL
    - container: must do SSL. Look how to run the show with apache.
            https://hub.docker.com/_/php

                FROM php:7.2-apache
                COPY src/ /var/www/html/

                docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-apache-php-app -v "$PWD":/var/www/html php:7.2-apache

    - ratchet: how to websocket server over SSL?
        - https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet/issues/609

- ratchet: 'Closed without sending a request; it was probably just an unused speculative preconnection'
    - for logs: helps to add the time - 10m (url differs each time)
    
- logs:
    - follow logs: log div should be no bigger than the screen (?) if 'follow logs' is on then scroll automatically to the bottom
        - if unchecking 'follow logs' then ignore further updates, without a refresh of the screen.

        Example:
            curl -vv --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/v1.41/containers/4c5342bf5c87/logs\?follow=true\&stdout=true\&stderr=true\&timestamps=true\&since=16691855 -H "Content-Type: application/json" --output x  

    - run container (lots of options).
        choices:
            - accept same command line as docker run
            - make choices available in a screen. (there are lots of options...)

--  error when trying to run shell, and shell doesn't exist.

    "OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/bin/sh": stat /bin/sh: no such file or directory: unknown"

    Need to copy statically compiled shell to container and run it!

            sent as X-Registry-Auth header as a base64url encoded (JSON) stringA

            {
              "username": "string",
              "password": "string",
              "email": "string",
              "serveraddress": "string"
            }

            The serveraddress is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.

            If you have already got an identity token from the /auth endpoint, you can just pass this instead of credentials:

            {
              "identitytoken": "9cbaf023786cd7..."
            }
